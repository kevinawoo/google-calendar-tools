# Tools/Methods

## createEndingSoonEvents
This is useful to get a notification that a calendar event is ending soon.

> Example: this created a `Ending Soon: Busy` at `20:45pm - 20:45pm` for the `Busy` event from `20:30pm - 20:45pm`
> 
> <kbd>![](.github/assets/ending_soon_and_blocked.png)</kbd>



It works by looking at your work calendar, then creating a `Ending Soon: XXXX` event at the ending time of your event on a 2nd calendar. These are one off events, each subsequent event will have its own.
 
Setup:
- You'll need to create a calendar, I called mines `ending-soon-cal`, and provide the calendar ID in the configurations. 
- Don't forget to set up the reminders!
- I have a calendar default reminder to go off at 5m and 0m prior to the event.


## blockWorkCalWithPersonEventPlaceholders
Double Booked all the time because of a personal event that didn't show up on your work calendar?? 
It's a pain to share a personal event with your work calendar for each event. 
It's also a pain to manually block out time on your work calendar for those events.

This script will look at your personal calendar, and create `Busy` events on your work calendar at the same time as your personal event. 

> Example: this created a `Busy` event for my personal event `moooooooo`
>
> <kbd>![](.github/assets/ending_soon_and_blocked.png)</kbd>

These are private events so no one calendar stalking you can see the title/details, to take it one step further, the placeholder event's title is just `Busy` (configurable). 

The only identifying information is the `eventID`, which I believe is randomly generated when creating a Calendar Event. 
I don't believe this leaks any information unless your calendar is shared or public. At that point, someone maybe able to find the event. Buuuut... your calendar is already public ü§î, so ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. 


## createWalkEvent
This will create "sunset walk events" that will get generated depending on your provided longitude and latitude. I use this to remind myself to go take a walk during the [Golden Hour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_hour_(photography)).

> Example event: this created a `[placeholder] Sunset Walk @16:58`, starting 1 hour before sunset and ending 30m after sunset
>

## cleanup
Is a helper script to remove all events on a calendar. Use with caution!

It's useful to blast away the events created by the `createEndingSoonEvents` or `createWalkEvent`


# Setup and Deploy

1. copy `config.example.ts` to `config.ts` and fill in the details
    ```bash
    cp src/config.ts.example src/config.ts
    ```

2. Setup a Google App Script
    - Go to https://script.google.com/ and create a new `Project`.
    - From the URL, grab the id, it'll look something like `https://script.google.com/home/projects/{YOUR_SCRIPT_ID_IS_HERE}/edit`.
      - Another way to get it is to go to the `‚öôÔ∏è Project Settings` page and you can find your Script ID.
    - Add this to `.clasp.json`
       ```json
      {
        "scriptId": "YOUR_SCRIPT_ID_IS_HERE",
        "rootDir": "dist"
      }
      ```

3. Install the packages
    ```bash
    npm i
    npm install -g clasp
    ```
  
4. Push it to Google Scripts
    ```bash
    clasp login
    npm run build-push
    ```
   If you run into problems with permissions with `clasp login` because of org policies,
   you can copy the `dist/bundle.js` directly into the Google App Script editor.
   
   Tip: add `.env` with `open "https://urlToScript"` to open the script in the browser.

5. Setup a project trigger
    1. setup a time based trigger on the 
    - `sync` function: every `30 minutes`
    - `createWalkEvent` function: `weekly every Monday 9-10am`
